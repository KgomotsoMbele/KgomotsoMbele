## Hi there 👋

I'm Kgomotso, a budding software engineer based in South Africa.

I like building applications and websites, no matter what the idea or end goal is, I am interested in everything. 

I normally dabble in almost all things tech but I have taken a liking to development as well as Linux.

The main tech stack I am familiar with is React Native using Typescript, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building on the skills I have learned in my studies so as to work in tech one day.
  The main skills are building Android applications using Kotlin, React Native applications using TypeScript, 
  and websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on large collaborative projects, I love working in a team alongside others,
working together to achieve one major goal.
I really find Git and GitHub fascinating and I am always itching for an opportunity to use it more.

- - ⚡ Fun facts:
  - I am a coffee snob
  - I love Monster Ultra (white can)
  - I am obssessed with cars and racing
  - I daily drive Windows 11 and Arch Linux together
  - I am always interested in trying new things
